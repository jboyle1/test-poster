## Name of Project: Test Poster (Juni Festkonzert - 1957)

This is a technical test for a job interview. It is a front end project focusing on HTML5 and CSS3. The task was to copy a poster using only HTML and CSS. It did not need to be responsive, but it should look correct in Chrome, Firefox, IE9, IE10 and IE11. I needed to aim to spend only 30 minutes on this task.
